# Hurricane-Analysis

This project is one of several Codecademy Pro Challenge Projects that I have completed as part of the Data Science Career Path. The main goal of this project is, according to Codeacademy, is "to write several functions that organize and manipulate data about Category 5 Hurricanes, the strongest hurricanes as rated by their wind speed. Each one of these functions will use a number of parameters, conditionals, lists, dictionaries, string manipulation, and return statements."
